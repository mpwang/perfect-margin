;;
;; # Usage
;;
;; Put perfect-margin under your Emacs load path, and add this to your init.el
;;
;; (require 'perfect-margin)
;;
;; Use `M-x perfect-margin-mode` to turn on/off perfect-margin.
;;
;; To make it permanent add this to your init.el after require.
;;
;; (perfect-margin-mode 1)
;;
;; Note: when using together with minimap or linum, make sure you place config for perfect-margin *AFTER* minimap and linum.
;;
;; # Customization
;;
;; Via `M-x customize-group` and enter perfect-margin.
;;
;; Change `perfect-margin-visible-width` and `Apply and Save`. That's it.
;;
;; *Or* you can change the visible window width by setup `perfect-margin-visible-width` on the init.el.
;;
;; (setq perfect-margin-visible-width 128)
;;
;; # Better minimap
;; perfect-margin works well with the original minimap, however, to get a even much better experience, use my enhanced [minimap](https://github.com/mpwang/emacs-minimap).
;;
;; I added support for perfect-mode to prevent the main window from "blinking" when the minimap is created.
;;
;; # Additional binding on margin area
;;
;; You can place this in your init.el to make mouse wheel scroll on margin area just like it scroll on the visible window.
;;
;; (dolist (margin '("<left-margin> " "<right-margin> "))
;;   (global-set-key (kbd (concat margin "<mouse-1>")) 'ignore)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd (concat margin "<mouse-3>")) 'ignore)
;;   (dolist (multiple '("" "double-" "triple-"))
;;     (global-set-key (kbd (concat margin "<" multiple "wheel-up>")) 'mwheel-scroll)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd (concat margin "<" multiple "wheel-down>")) 'mwheel-scroll)
;;     ))
